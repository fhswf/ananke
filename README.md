# Ananke Jupyter Distribution

The Ananke project provides preconfigured [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) images for [Podman](https://podman.io) (a [Docker](https://www.docker.com)-like containerization tool) with a focus on integrating [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) and [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io) into learning management systems (LMS) like [Moodle](https://moodle.org), [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) and many others.

The project's core is the Kore service providing GUI-based course management and an [LTI 1.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Tools_Interoperability) interface for nbgrader.

Target group are administrators of small to medium-sized JupyterHubs used in teaching environments with a handful of courses.
The project's focus is not on large-scale JupyterHubs with thousands of users but on:
* easy setup and operation for instructors and students,
* advice and preconfiguration for administrators,
* flexibility to implement different application scenarios.

Also have a look at [Ananke website](https://gauss.fh-zwickau.de/ananke).

## Overall architecture

The structure of an Ananke-based JupyterHub deployment is as follows:
* A host machine runs one or several Podman containers.
* Each container represents one JupyterHub, which may be used by a whole university or a department or by only one instructor depending on individual configuration needs.
* Each JupyterHub provides individual JupyterLabs for all its users (instructors and students).

## Available container images

The Ananke project uses [Podman](https://podman.io) for containerization.
Podman is free, open source, and compatible with [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
There are several reasons to choose Podman over Docker, the biggest being security-related (rootless containers, daemon-less).

The Ananke project provides the following container images:
* `ananke-base` (JupyterHub with LTI login and nbgitpuller)
* `ananke-nbgrader` (like `ananke-base` plus LTI integrated nbgrader)

## Documentation

See `doc` subdirectory.
There's also an [HTML rendering of the doc](https://gauss.fh-zwickau.de/ananke/doc).

## Quickstart
Here are the major steps to get your own JupyterHub with LMS integration:
1. Get a server with Debian Linux (other distros should work, too).
2. Download or build an Ananke Podman image.
3. Choose a configuration template.
4. Create a container.
5. Configure your LMS.

See [documentation](https://gauss.fh-zwickau.de/ananke/doc) for detailled install instructions.
