# Container based on Ananke nbgrader image

This directory contains shell scripts for creating and removing a container.

**Important**: make this directory your working directory (`cd ...`) before you run the scripts, else the container won't work correctly.

Create and run a container:
```
run.sh
```

Start a shell inside the container:
```
shell.sh
```

Remove the container:
```
remove.sh
```
