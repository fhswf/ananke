# For hub admins 

Hub admins have maximum permission in JupyterHub.
They may have a look into running JupyterLabs, and they may stop the JupyterLab of some user.

## Become a hub admin

To become a hub admin log in to the hub and get your user ID from the URL shown in your browser's address bar (`.../user/YOUR_USER_ID/lab`).
The container admin has to add your user ID to the hub's configuration file.

## Manage user servers

To get a list of all currently running JupyterLabs click 'File', then 'Hub Control Panel'.
In the control panel's top navigation bar click 'Admin'.
