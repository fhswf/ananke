# Ananke documentation

The Ananke project provides preconfigured [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) images for [Podman](https://podman.io) (a [Docker](https://www.docker.com)-like containerization tool) with a focus on integrating [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) and [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io) into learning management systems (LMS) like [Moodle](https://moodle.org), [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) and many others.

The project's core is the Kore service providing GUI-based course management and an [LTI 1.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Tools_Interoperability) interface for nbgrader.

Target group are administrators of small to medium-sized JupyterHubs used in teaching environments with a handful of courses.
The project's focus is not on large-scale JupyterHubs with thousands of users but on:
* easy setup and operation for instructors and students,
* advice and preconfiguration for administrators,
* flexibility to implement different application scenarios.

## Overall architecture

The structure of an Ananke-based JupyterHub deployment is as follows:
* A host machine runs one or several Podman containers.
* Each container represents one JupyterHub, which may be used by a whole university or a department or by only one instructor depending on individual configuration needs.
* One host machine may provide several JupyterHubs with different configurations and features.
* Each JupyterHub provides individual JupyterLabs for all its users (instructors and students).

## Available container images

The Ananke project uses [Podman](https://podman.io) for containerization.
Podman is free, open source, and compatible with [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
There are several reasons to choose Podman over Docker, the biggest being security-related (rootless containers, daemon-less).

The Ananke project provides the following container images:
* `ananke-base` (JupyterHub with LTI login and nbgitpuller)
* `ananke-nbgrader` (like `ananke-base` plus LTI integrated nbgrader)

## Where to go from here?
